# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description 

The is a code refactor of the Horiseon webpage. The purpose of the refactor was for search engine optimisation and to bring the code up to accessibility standards.

Whilst working on the code I found several issues that affected the accessibility of the page, such as the use of div elements throughout and the absence of alt attributes for images. I also fixed some small bugs and condensed some repetitive code within the CSS file.

Comments have been added throughout the HTML and CSS files to identify all changes that were made to the code.

The webpage is now fully functional and more accessible.
